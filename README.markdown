# Web Log

This is a small app which uses a NSStatusItem with a custom view to allow dragging/droping of url's and saves them for later use in a similar way to Read it Later.

Clicking on a bookmark will open it in the default browser. But it also allows the user to delete a bookmark by holding down the  command-key when clicking on a menu item (bookmark).
